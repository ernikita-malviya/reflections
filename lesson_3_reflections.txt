When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you have to work with a group or you want to share code between computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

1) Because other contributers nay be working concurrently. 2) You may not want to push to 
the master until you have a working version.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?

A fork is a github concept which allows you to copy someone elses github repository to 
your own github repository. Cloning is copying a repository either from a remote to local 
or from a local to local. In addition when cloning a new .git/config file is created. 
Lastly a branch is just a git object that stores a reference to a commit and any commit 
following the creation of a branch will be seperate from other branches. You would use a 
branch when you want to maintain two similar but different copies of content such as 
creating a new feature in software.
