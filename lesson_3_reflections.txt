When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you have to work with a group or you want to share code between computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

1) Because other contributers nay be working concurrently. 2) You may not want to push to the master until you have a working version.
